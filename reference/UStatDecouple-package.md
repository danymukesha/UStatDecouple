# UStatDecouple: Probabilistic Decoupling for U-Statistics in Genomic Analysis

Decoupling techniques for U-statistics to transform dependent sample
statistics into averages of independent sequences, specifically
optimized for genomic data analysis. Provides tools for variance
estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval construction for
complex genomic metrics.

This package implements probabilistic decoupling techniques for
U-statistics, transforming dependent sample statistics into averages of
independent sequences. It provides tools for genomic data analysis
including variance estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence
interval construction for complex genomic metrics.
