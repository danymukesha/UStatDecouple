Description: Decoupling techniques for U-statistics to transform
    dependent sample statistics into averages of independent sequences, 
    specifically optimized for genomic data analysis. Provides tools for 
    variance estimation, hypothesis testing, and confidence interval 
    construction for complex genomic metrics.
